## Conclusions
During the development and configuration of E2E tests for the SauceDemo application using Cypress, several challenges were encountered, and effective solutions were implemented to address them. Here are the detailed conclusions:

## CORS and Preflight Requests Issues:

Description: While running the tests, errors related to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) were encountered, specifically preflight requests being blocked due to missing Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers.
Solution: Intercepting and modifying requests in Cypress to add the necessary headers allowed the requests to pass correctly. This was achieved using the modifyCORSHeaders command.
Authentication and Session Management:

The functionality for placing an order and receiving a confirmation message works as expected.
